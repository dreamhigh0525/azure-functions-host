<h2>Bad Config</h2>
<p>
The configuration is not properly set for the SimpleBatch Function Dashboard.
In your configuration (such as web.config), you must set a key <i>MainStorage</i> that points to the account connection string where the sb logs are being stored. EG, under "AppSettings" in Web.config, add a value like:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;add key="SimpleBatchLoggingACS" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<b>NAME</b>;AccountKey=<b>KEY</b>" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Either that key is missing, it's malformed (not a valid connection string), or it's not set to a valid storage account. 
This is the storage account that your user functions will bind against.  This is also where logging will be stored.
