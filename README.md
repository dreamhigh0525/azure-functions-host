Azure WebJobs SDK Script
===
This repo contains libraries that enable a light-weight scripting model for the [Azure WebJobs SDK](http://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk). You provide a one or more function scripts written in various languages (e.g. Node.js, CSharp, etc.) along with a simple manifest.json file that indicates how those functions should be invoked, and the scripting library does the work necessary to plug those scripts into the WebJobs SDK JobHost.
