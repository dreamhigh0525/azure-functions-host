Azure Jobs
===
Azure Jobs is a framework that simplifies the task of adding background processing in Azure WebJobs.

Azure Jobs has a binding and trigger system which works with Azure Storage Blobs, Queues and Tables as well as Service
Bus. The binding system makes it easy to write code that reads or writes Azure Storage objects. The trigger system calls
a function in your code whenever any new data is received in a queue or blob.

The WebJobs feature of Azure Web Sites provides an easy way for you to run programs such as services or background tasks
in a Web Site. You can upload and run an executable file such as an .exe, .cmd, or .bat file to your web site. When
using Azure Jobs to write WebJobs, it provides an integrated Dashboard with rich monitoring and diagnostics information.
